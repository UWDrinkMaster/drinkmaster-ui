The application allows for users to specify their allergies so that they are notified whenever a drink contains that allergen.

The user will be prompted to complete a test to ensure that they are sober enough to order more drinks every 30 minutes. This test involves tapping 25 circles in order from 1 to 25 as fast as possible.
